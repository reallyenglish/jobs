You keep abreast of industry design developments and technology and enjoy sharing information, ideas and best practice with other design team members. You always think from the users point of view and can gauge the usability of new and existing products, and make constructive suggestions for change. You can work with other developers whose first language is not English. Ideally, you live in London or would consider relocating from outside London or the UK for the right role.
